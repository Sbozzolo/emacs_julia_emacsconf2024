# Exploring shared philosophies between Julia and Emacs

While seemingly disparate, the Julia programming language and Emacs share a
surprising kinship. This talk delves into the common design principles and
philosophies that unite these powerful tools, focusing on their shared emphasis
on extensibility, customization, and interactive development. I'll explore how
both Julia and Emacs empower users to tailor their experience through powerful
metaprogramming and a rich ecosystem of extensions. I'll discuss the REPL-driven
workflows that foster exploration and experimentation in both environments.
Furthermore, I'll examine how their active and passionate communities drive
innovation.
